# What is this?
This is a simple card game called 99 implemented in ReactJS. You can find more information about the rules at https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/99-ninety-nine/ It is deployed on heroku: https://afternoon-mesa-03666.herokuapp.com . The project is 90% complete with some boundary cases left and there's opportunity to create various different modes and enhance user experience

# Interesting things learned/Improved
* React Hooks(useContext,useState, useEffect)
* Using free API
* Asychronous/Synchronous functions
* Mutable/Immutable 
* ReactJS strict mode
* Object renaming 
* Refactoring/Reusing code
* Spread operator
* Styled Components library
* Debugger 
* Higher order functions (filter, map)

# Problems i've ran into
* ReactStates firing twice. This is part of ReactJS strict mode. It's bad practice to mutate objects. 
* Updating states. You want to use callback functions and update using prevstate 

#Things to add for future
* Better UI: Card animations using library
* Player vs player using Socket.io
* Smarter AI using min-max algorithim (currently, the AI is very naive, i decided to sort and have AI select the largest card)
